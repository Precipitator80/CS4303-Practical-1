# CS4303 Practical 1: Ballista Command / ‘Asteroid Defence’

The specification outlined the creation of a variant of the classic video game Missile Command through use of the Processing language. The final implementation includes the variations specified, including the use of simple gravity and drag physics simulation. In addition to this, the variant extends upon the original game through the inclusion of an upgrade shop, starting options menu and an extensive class inheritance system to support easier future development of games in Processing.
